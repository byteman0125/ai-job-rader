### 13. Complete HTML Content Collection (NEW APPROACH)
- **Before**: Used `innerText.substring(0, 15000)` - lost HTML structure and truncated content
- **After**: Uses `outerHTML` of entire page - preserves ALL HTML elements and structure
- **Benefit**: AI can now see the complete page structure including:
  - `<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>` tags for job titles
  - HTML element hierarchy and context
  - ALL page content without truncation
  - Better understanding of where job information is located

### 14. Element-by-Element Page Analysis
- **Added**: `analyzePageStructure()` function that collects content by element types:
  - **Headings**: All h1-h6 tags (potential job titles)
  - **Buttons**: Apply buttons and job type indicators
  - **Tags/Badges**: Job type indicators (Remote, Hybrid, etc.)
  - **Company Elements**: Logo and brand elements
  - **Job Type Elements**: Remote/hybrid/onsite specific elements
- **Benefit**: Better understanding of page structure and element relationships

### 15. HTML-Aware AI Processing
- **Before**: AI received plain text without structure
- **After**: AI receives full HTML with instructions to look for job titles in heading tags
- **Benefit**: More accurate extraction based on HTML element hierarchy and importance
